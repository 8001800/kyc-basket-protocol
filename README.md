# Basket Protocol: KYC Version

[![Build Status](https://jenkins.coinalpha.com/buildStatus/icon?job=kyc-basket-protocol&build=4)](https://jenkins.coinalpha.com/job/kyc-basket-protocol/4/)
[![Coverage Status](https://coveralls.io/repos/github/CoinAlpha/kyc-basket-protocol/badge.svg?branch=master&t=VuHnjw)](https://coveralls.io/github/CoinAlpha/kyc-basket-protocol?branch=master)

This branch builds off of CoinAlpha's base [Basket Protocol](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/basket-protocol).  For more information about the basic functions of the protocol, please go to the [Basket Protocol repo](https://github.com/CoinAlpha/basket-protocol).

This KYC version of the Basket Protocol adds whitelisting functionality: a protocol administrator (`owner`) and another authorized party, the `KYC Admin`, have the ability to whitelist Ethereum addresses which will be allowed to hold Basket Tokens.  Only Ethereum addresses that have been whitelisted will be able to hold Basket Tokens; any transfers to or transactions that would involve a transfer to a non-whitelisted address are not permitted and will fail.

For more discussion of this version of the protocol, please see this medium post: [CoinAlpha Releases KYC-Enabled Version of Basket¬†Protocol](https://medium.com/finance-3/coinalpha-releases-kyc-enabled-version-of-basket-protocol-10a99e3b13ac).


### KYC Whitelist Module

The [KYC.sol](contracts/KYC.sol) contract is introduced in this version of the Basket Protocol to implement the whitelisting functionality.

The main functions are summarized below:

```js
// Query if an address is whitelisted
function isWhitelistedHolder(address _holder) public view returns (bool)
```

```js
// Function to whitelist an Ethereum address
function whitelistHolder(address _addressToWhitelist) public onlyOwnerOrAdmin returns (bool) 
```

```js
// Function to remove an address from the whitelist
function unWhitelistHolder(address _addressToUnwhitelist) public onlyOwnerOrAdmin returns (bool)
```

**Dependencies on KYC.sol**

The contracts which involve potential transfers of Baskets Tokens (namely [Basket.sol](contracts/Basket.sol) and [BasketEscrow.sol](contracts/BasketEscrow.sol)) connect to [KYC.sol](contracts/KYC.sol) to verify validity of the recipient Ethereum address.

## Security
The CoinAlpha team, to the extent possible, aims to follow industry best practices and keep up to date with the rapidly developing field of smart contracts and blockchain engineering.  Some of the guides and best practices followed include:
- [OpenZeppelin contracts](https://github.com/OpenZeppelin/zeppelin-solidity): the Basket Protocol uses some of the standardized and widely accepted OpenZeppelin contracts
- [ConsenSys: Smart Contract Security Best Practices](https://github.com/ConsenSys/smart-contract-best-practices)
